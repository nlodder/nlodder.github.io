							<p>
                As part of an introduction to engineering course, my team of 3 classmates designed and
                built a robot on the VEX EXP robot platform for a set of self-defined goals. Our robot would
                (1) launch small 3D-printed balls at coloured targets, (2) scan for and collect four of these
                balls using their pink colour signature, and (3) deliver these balls to a designated area marked
                by an orange paper pillar.
              </p>
							<p>
                I contributed in a few different ways to this project. I worked with my team to design and build
                the robot. I wrote, tested, and made operational the code to seek, identify, approach, and collect
                the pink balls. I also implemented large-area scanning that would ensure the robot continually scanned
                a large area for a pink ball if none were found nearby. I also integrated all work completed by my teammates
                in our parallel development approach into a single control program for the robot that enabled it to execute
                the ball launching, collecting, and delivery into a single program.
